# Insights-from-Failed-Orders
Tasks :

1 - Build up distribution of orders according to reasons for failure: cancellations before and after driver assignment, and reasons for order rejection. Analyse the resulting plot. Which category has the highest number of orders?
my opinon :
I found that the high number of orders canceled was before a driver is assigned, implying that maybe customers have waited too long and have decided on an alternative for their transportation needs. 
orders canceled by the client is 13435 orders, and 9469 rejected by the system.
The clients canceled  8360 orders after a driver has been assigned, and only four were rejected by the system.


2 - Plot the distribution of failed orders by hours. Is there a trend that certain hours have an abnormally high proportion of one category or another? What hours are the biggest fails? How can this be explained?

3 - Plot the average time to cancellation with and without driver, by the hour. If there are any outliers in the data, it would be better to remove them. Can we draw any conclusions from this plot?

4 - Plot the distribution of average ETA by hours. How can this plot be explained?
